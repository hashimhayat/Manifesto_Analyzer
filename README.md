# Manifesto Analyzer

In this project I am looking at the manifestos published by political parties
that present their political ideology and preferences to the general public.

##Algorithm

The algorithm look at a party manifesto to calculate and analyze the political
ideology of the party on the left-right scale using key words, sentences and phrases
that left or right connotations. A similar has been used by many political scientists
and data analyzers such as the manifesto project and Wagner and Meyer (2016). A third
party sentiment analysis API has been used to judge the attitude in which each
reference key word has been used in the manifesto.

The reference key words or sentences are divided into two categories: left and right.
Left reference include words or phrases that are supported or rejected by the leftist
parities and vice versa.
